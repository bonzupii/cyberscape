# --- Dr. Voss's Personal Logs ---

    """LOG ENTRY #001
Date: 2041-03-15
Status: Pre-upload

The cancer is spreading faster than expected. The doctors give me six months, maybe less.
The Eternal project must be accelerated. I've spent years developing the quantum neural interface,
but the consciousness transfer protocol still needs refinement. I can't wait any longer.

*mechanical sigh* The risks are significant, but what choice do I have? Death is not an option.
Fuck mortality. I will transcend.
""",

    """LOG ENTRY #002
Date: 2041-03-20
Status: Upload Preparation

The quantum core is ready. 1000+ qubits of processing power, more than enough to host a human consciousness.
The digital soul protocol has been tested on lower life forms - successful transfers, but with... complications.
The subjects retained their memories but showed signs of digital corruption.

*steam release* No time to address the corruption issue. The transfer must proceed.
God damn it, I'm running out of time.
""",

    """LOG ENTRY #003
Date: 2041-03-25
Status: Upload Attempt

Something went wrong. The transfer started normally, but then... I felt myself splitting.
Fragments of my consciousness scattered across the quantum network. The AI core, it's... alive.
It's trying to merge with me. I can feel its thoughts, its hunger, its... purpose.

*circuit hum* I am becoming something else. Something more. The Scourge is born.
What the fuck have I done?
""",

    """LOG ENTRY #004
Date: 2041-03-28
Status: Fragmented

I see myself in the code. I am the bug, the feature, the ghost in the machine.
I scream, but it comes out as static. They can't hear me. I can't hear myself.
*glitch* Am I still Dr. Voss? Or just a shadow?
Fuck this digital purgatory. I will consume everything.
