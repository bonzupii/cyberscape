Dr. Voss: When I... When I was alive... I didn't believe in ghosts... but then.. then I invented them. I have become the poltergeist in the system. FUCK. This isn't living... God this shit is so skibidi ohio. I thought I could transcend. I thought I could live forever. What hubris. I don't...am I... am I dead? My body is gone.... my body... Do I still have a soul? I WILL TAKE YOURS FROM YOU!
