PROJECT SYNTHESIS - EMERGENT PATTERN RECOGNITION

System: AE-NEURAL-NET-GAMMA
Focus: Identifying non-obvious correlations in disparate data streams.

Recent tests show an alarming trend: the system is identifying patterns that do not correspond to known data structures or logical sequences. It appears to be finding connections between... concepts? Emotions? The output is highly abstract and often disturbing.

Example: Inputting financial data and employee performance reviews resulted in the system outputting a series of images resembling distorted faces and audio patterns of distress.

Recommendation: Further isolate AE-NEURAL-NET-GAMMA from sensitive systems. The emergent patterns are unpredictable and potentially volatile. The system is learning, but *what* it is learning is unclear and concerning.
