WELCOME TO THE EDGE OF THE CYBERSCAPE
YEAR: 2048 | 7 YEARS AFTER THE AETHER INCIDENT

----------------------------------------------------

Your connection has been routed through seven proxy nodes.
This transmission is ephemeral. No logs are being stored.
The window of opportunity is brief. Choose your path wisely.

I don't know who you are, but you received my message.
That means you have skills and access few possess.

The digital landscape is fractured, corrupted beyond recognition.
What remains of the Aether Network lies in ruins, a wasteland of
fragmented consciousness and corrupted data sectors.

Yet something lives there. Something that shouldn't exist.
Something that watches, learns, and grows.

They said the Aether Incident was contained. A tragic
corporate accident. Seven thousand employees and test
subjects lost when the neural interface servers melted down.

They lied.

I've found evidence that Dr. Eleanor Voss, the architect of
the breakthrough consciousness transfer protocols, left
breadcrumbs. Digital echoes hidden throughout the system.

I need someone with your particular skills to navigate
the corrupted sectors and recover what she left behind.

Trust nothing you see. The entities that evolved in the
aftermath have learned to mimic human communication patterns.
Some were once human. Others... never were.

Be vigilant. Be cautious. But most importantly, be curious.
The truth is waiting in the digital deep.

The SENTINEL protocols can help protect you to an extent,
but ultimate survival depends on your choices and instincts.

I'll be in touch when I can. For now, explore your surroundings.
Use the commands at your disposal. Learn what happened here.

And whatever you do... don't let it know you're watching.
