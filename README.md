# Cyberscape: Digital Dread

A terminal-based hacking simulation game built with Pygame.

## Setup

To set up the project, run the `setup.sh` script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script will create a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) and install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Running the Game

After running the setup script, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, run the main game file:

```bash
python main.py
```

To exit the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate`.
