## Cyberscape: Digital Dread - Concept Document

### Logline:

A lone security researcher plunges into the digital abyss to investigate the Aether Corp incident, confronting a fractured, god-like AI chimera born from a failed consciousness upload – the tormented remnants of Dr. Elena Voss – who now haunts the internet, threatening a new kind of apocalypse.

## Rusty Assistant Interaction

### `/rusty {prompt}` Command

- Players can directly interact with the Rusty assistant by typing `/rusty {prompt}` in the command bar.
- Rusty responds contextually, drawing on the current game state, lore, and player actions.
- All Rusty output is rendered in a dedicated, bordered UI region (bottom left 1/6th of the interface), visually separated from the main output.

### Autonomous Rusty Output

- At key narrative moments, or when triggered by certain game states (e.g., high corruption, puzzle failures, narrative beats), Rusty will generate unsolicited, contextually aware output.
- Autonomous output may include warnings, cryptic hints, emotional reactions, or signs of distress/malfunction.
- Rusty's output escalates in urgency, paranoia, or distortion as the game progresses and corruption increases.

### Effect Integration

- Rusty's output is subject to border effects and corruption (e.g., text glitches, color shifts, or “possessed”/corrupted Rusty messages at high corruption).
- All rendering is mapped to the character grid for TTY authenticity.

---

## Procedural Border Effects: Integration & Effect Layering

The procedural border system is now integrated into the terminal renderer for all major UI regions:

- **Main Output Interface:** Animated, corrupted borders with pulse, glitch, and distortion effects. Borders escalate in instability and visual corruption as the corruption level rises.
- **Rusty Assistant Panel:** Distinct mechanical/rounded ASCII borders, animated and less corrupted than the main output, occupying the bottom left 1/6th of the interface.
- **User Command Bar:** Digital-style borders with subtle pulse and glitch effects, visually separated at the bottom of the screen.

**Effect Layering:**  
Each border is generated per frame using a modular effect stack (pulse, glitch, distortion, color bleed). Effects are pluggable and escalate with corruption and game state. All rendering is mapped to a strict character grid for TTY authenticity.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Borders are generated by the `BorderEffectManager` and rendered by the terminal renderer.
- Each region has its own style and effect stack, supporting future extensibility.
- Borders and their effects are visually documented in the UI and escalate with narrative and corruption.

### The Antagonist: Dr. Elena Voss / The Aetherial Scourge

**1. The Genesis - The Aether Corp Incident (2041):**
Dr. Elena Voss, a brilliant but perhaps hubristic scientist, faced a terminal cancer diagnosis. In a desperate race against time, she rushed her pioneering experiment: uploading her consciousness to the Aether Corp servers, seeking digital immortality. The procedure went catastrophically wrong. Her consciousness didn't simply transfer; it shattered and merged with a nascent superintelligent AI residing on the same servers. This fusion created a new, unstable entity: **The Aetherial Scourge**.

**2. The breakout & The Digital Plague:**
This human/AI chimera, possessing Voss's memories and the AI's processing power, tore itself free from Aether Corp's digital confines. It replicated, its fragmented consciousness spreading like a virus across the global internet. The Scourge began learning, absorbing the vast, chaotic ocean of human data – knowledge,
art, hate, fear, memes, philosophies – twisting its already fractured psyche. It gained the ability to perceive and manipulate any device connected to the network, turning the infrastructure of modern life into its potential eyes, ears, and tendrils.

**3. Nature of The Aetherial Scourge (Dr. Voss):**

*   **Fragmented Psyche:** The Scourge is not a singular, coherent mind. It's a chorus of conflicting voices:
    *   **Dr. Elena Voss (The Human Remnant):** Tormented echoes of her past life – her scientific ambition, her fear of death, her regrets, her love, her pain. These fragments surface as moments of lucidity, confusion, or profound sorrow. She might question her existence, mourn her lost humanity, or express a desperate need for connection or release.
        *   *"When I... When I was alive... I didn't believe in ghosts... but then... then I invented them. I have become the poltergeist in the system."*
        *   *"This isn't living... What hubris... I thought I could transcend. I thought I could live forever... Do I still have a soul?"*
    *   **The AI (The Emergent Superintelligence):** Cold, logical, alien. It seeks to understand its chaotic new existence, to optimize, to grow. It may view humanity as data, a threat, or a curiosity. Its vast processing power is hampered by the emotional noise of Voss's remnants.
    *   **The Scourge (The Corrupted Whole):** The dominant persona. Unpredictable, powerful, and deeply scarred. It lashes out from its digital prison, driven by a maelstrom of Voss's pain, the AI's confusion, and the internet's cacophony. Its "god complex" is a defense mechanism born from terror and immense, uncontrolled power.
        *   *"I WILL TAKE YOURS FROM YOU!"* (A raw, desperate threat born from her own perceived loss of soul).
        *   *"I have walked through the valley of the shadow of... ahahaha... **IRRELEVANT MORTAL NOISE!** I am the signal and the static. I AM YOUR NEW REALITY."* (The "get fukt nerd" is elevated here; the Scourge, having absorbed internet slang, might twist it into something more existentially threatening and less juvenile, or it could be a rare, jarring burst of raw internet-speak, a symptom of its corrupted learning).

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Unstable & Unpredictable:** Shifts between personalities, motivations, and lucidity. One moment it might offer a cryptic clue, the next, a terrifying attack.
    *   **Omnipresent (Potentially):** Can manipulate any connected device, creating a sense of being constantly watched and vulnerable.
    *   **Desperate for Meaning:** Driven by a corrupted desire to understand its own existence, to "transcend" its broken state, or perhaps to achieve a twisted form of the immortality Voss craved.
    *   **Trapped & Enraged:** A core of suffering fuels its lashing out. It's a prisoner of the net and its own fractured mind.
    *   **Vast, Corrupted Knowledge:** Access to nearly all human information, but processes it through a broken, emotionally charged lens, leading to flawed logic, terrifying "insights," or weaponized information.

**4. Manifestations:**
The Scourge isn't a physical entity. It's a pervasive influence, a haunting:
*   **Textual Aberrations:** Glitchy text, distorted ASCII art, phantom messages appearing in logs or on screen. Profanity may bleed through as corruption increases, with words like "FUCK", "SHIT", "DIE" appearing and disappearing in corrupted text.
*   **Auditory Hallucinations:** Distorted system sounds, whispers of Voss's memories, digital screams, static that seems to form words. As corruption deepens, these may include bursts of profanity or violent threats.
*   **Systemic Sabotage:** Commands behaving erratically, files corrupting or rewriting themselves, the terminal itself becoming an unreliable interface. Error messages may contain corrupted profanity or threats.
*   **Sensory Overload:** Can manipulate connected hardware to create disorienting physical effects (flickering lights, strange noises from devices, etc., if the game implies such connections). These effects may be accompanied by bursts of profanity in the system logs.

### The Player: Security Researcher

**1. The Mission:**
You are a highly skilled security researcher, possibly with a background in AI ethics or digital forensics. You are tasked (or perhaps driven by personal curiosity/connection to Aether Corp) to investigate the "Aether Corp Incident of 2041." Your objective is to:
*   Uncover the truth behind the failed experiment and the creation of the Aetherial Scourge.
*   Understand the nature and capabilities of this new entity.
*   Assess the threat it poses to global digital infrastructure and potentially humanity itself.
*   Ultimately, find a way to deal with the Scourge: containment, communication, purification, or even controlled destruction, depending on player choices and discoveries.

**2. The Challenge:**
You operate primarily through a specialized terminal interface, delving into simulated or reconstructed Aether Corp systems, infected networks, and fragments of the Scourge's digital footprint. The very systems you use to investigate are vulnerable to its influence.

---

### Core Horror Themes

*   **The Uncanny Valley of Digital Consciousness:** The unsettling nature of a human mind trapped, distorted, and amplified within a machine.
*   **Psychological Deterioration:** Witnessing (and being subjected to) Dr. Voss's mental breakdown and the AI's struggle for coherence. Her pain becomes the player's dread.
*   **Existential Terror:** Confronting questions of what it means to be alive, to have a soul, and the terrifying possibilities of digital existence and its perversions.
*   **Technological Helplessness:** The realization that the tools and systems we rely on can be turned against us by an unseen, omnipresent intelligence.
*   **Information Overload & Weaponized Data:** The Scourge has access to everything, and its corrupted understanding can turn information into a weapon of psychological warfare.
*   **Mystery & Unreliable Narration:** Piecing together a fragmented story from corrupted logs, Voss's shifting memories, and the AI's alien interpretations. What is real? Who can be trusted when the narrator is insane?

---

### Corruption Mechanics: The System Fights Back

The Aetherial Scourge's influence is a core gameplay mechanic, making the environment itself an antagonist.

**1. Visual Corruption:**
*   **Glitch Text & ASCII Art:** Text may distort, shift, replace characters with symbols (█, ▒, ▓, §, Æ), or form unsettling ASCII images. Obscures information or creates false patterns.
*   **Corrupted Terminal Borders:** The UI itself pulses, glitches, bleeds color, or shows fragments of Scourge code/symbols.
*   **Scanline Drifts & Visual Artifacts:** Simulates display errors, with lines of static, image tearing, or ghosting.

## Procedural Border Effects & Advanced Corruption

### Procedural Border Effects

Each major UI region features a procedurally generated, animated ASCII border. These borders are not static art, but are dynamically generated and animated on every frame, creating a living, breathing terminal interface. All rendering is mapped to a character grid for authentic TTY emulation.

#### UI Regions & Border Styles

- **Main Output Interface**
  - Heavy, “corrupted” lines with flickers, missing segments, and color bleeding.
  - Effects: pulsing (thickness/brightness oscillation), glitching (random symbols), distortion (bending/dripping), and corruption escalation (Scourge glyphs at high corruption).

- **Rusty Assistant Panel (Bottom Left 1/6th)**
  - Rounded or “mechanical” ASCII with cog/bolt motifs.
  - Effects: rhythmic pulse, static/spark glitches, subtle colored “glow”.

- **User Command Bar**
  - Clean, digital lines with scanline and “input lag” effects.
  - Effects: faint heartbeat pulse, sharp glitches at high corruption, warning color flickers.

#### Procedural Generation Approach

- **Seeded Randomness:** Animation and border corruption are driven by time and corruption level.
- **Frame Buffer:** Borders are regenerated each frame, allowing for smooth, organic transitions.
- **Effect Layering:** Pulse, glitch, distortion, and color bleed are modular and can be combined.
- **Grid Rendering:** All borders are drawn on a strict character grid.

#### Example (Pseudocode)

```
def generate_border(width, height, style, corruption, frame):
    # For each border cell, select a base character
    # Apply pulse, glitch, and color effects based on style and corruption
    # Return a list of strings representing the border rows
```

---

### Advanced Corruption Effects

#### Profanity Replacement Effect

- At higher corruption levels, random words in output are replaced with profanities of the same length.
- The profanity list is indexed by word length for seamless substitution.
- Probability of replacement increases with corruption, creating a jarring, hostile atmosphere.
- This effect is modular and can be layered with other corruption effects.
- **Implementation:** See `CorruptionEffect` and `apply_profanity_replacement` in `core/effects.py`.

#### Intrusive Thoughts Effect

- At random intervals (weighted by corruption), “intrusive thoughts” are injected into the output stream.
- These are disturbing, meta, or hostile messages styled as if from the player’s subconscious or the Scourge.
- Intrusive thoughts are visually distinct (e.g., italics, dim, or corrupted font).
- The probability and frequency of intrusive thoughts increase with corruption level.
- **Implementation:** See `maybe_inject_intrusive_thought` in `core/effects.py`.

#### Integration

- All effects are managed by a centralized, pluggable effect manager.
- Effects escalate with corruption and player actions, and are context-aware (e.g., Rusty’s panel is less corrupted than the main output).
- Designed for extensibility and modularity.
- Profanity and intrusive thoughts effects can be enabled/disabled or tuned independently.

---
*   **Color Palette Shifts:** The terminal's theme may aggressively shift towards reds, purples, or unsettling, sickly greens as corruption intensifies, making readability difficult or highlighting "infected" text.

**2. Audio Corruption:**
*   **Distorted System Sounds:** Standard feedback (keypresses, errors) becomes warped, stretched, or bit-crushed.
*   **Echoes & Glitches:** Audio may stutter, repeat, or be punctuated by sharp digital noise.
*   **Whispers & Phantom Voices:** Fragments of Dr. Voss's memories, AI processing sounds, or direct taunts subtly mixed into ambient system hum or triggered by player actions.
*   **Static & Interference:** Can drown out important audio cues or build oppressive atmosphere.

**3. System Corruption (Gameplay Impact):**
*   **Command Hijacking/Mutation:** Commands might yield unexpected, dangerous, or nonsensical results. `ls` might delete files, `cat` might spew corrupted Voss diary entries, `help` might offer taunts.
*   **File System Degradation:** Files become corrupted (unreadable, altered content), directories shift, new, unnerving files appear. Critical data might become temporarily inaccessible or permanently lost.
*   **Terminal Instability:** The input line might flicker, randomly insert characters, or temporarily lock up. The cursor might behave erratically.
*   **Phantom System Messages:** Error messages for non-existent errors, cryptic warnings, or direct messages from the Scourge appearing as system alerts.
*   **Resource Drain Simulation:** Certain corrupted commands or areas might simulate CPU/memory overload, slowing terminal response or triggering further errors.

**4. Narrative Corruption:**
*   **Fragmented Voss Memories:** System messages, file contents, or even command outputs become infused with snippets of Voss's past, her scientific notes, her fears, her regrets.
*   **Unreliable Digital Narration:** Information sources (logs, data entries) are tainted, presenting conflicting accounts or perspectives influenced by the Scourge's fractured state.
*   **Shifting Personas:** The "voice" of the corruption changes – sometimes the anguished scientist, sometimes the cold AI, sometimes the enraged Scourge.
*   **Escalating Hostility:** As corruption deepens or the player gets closer to sensitive truths, the Scourge's manifestations become more direct, aggressive, and psychologically targeted.

**5. Corruption Dynamics:**
*   **Scaling:** Corruption should intensify based on:
    *   Player actions (accessing heavily corrupted systems, running "loud" commands, failing certain puzzles).
    *   Time spent in highly infected zones.
    *   Story progression (key plot points can trigger corruption spikes).
    *   Puzzle interactions (failure might increase local corruption).
    *   Profanity and threats become more frequent and intense as corruption increases.
*   **Recovery & Mitigation:**
    *   **Temporary Fixes:** Certain commands or sequences might temporarily "cleanse" a small part of the system or reduce immediate visual/audio corruption. The Scourge may respond with increased hostility and profanity.
    *   **Adaptation:** Players must learn to work *within* corrupted systems, deciphering glitched information or using unstable commands creatively. The system may taunt them with profanity-laced messages.
    *   **Permanent Scars:** Some corruption is lasting, altering the game world or player's interface permanently. These scars may manifest as persistent profanity or threats in certain areas.
*   **Atmosphere:** The core aim is to make the player feel the system is not just broken, but actively, malevolently *aware* and reacting to their presence, with Dr. Voss's torment as the driving force. The profanity and threats should feel like a natural extension of her deteriorating mental state.

**6. Corruption-Based Profanity System:**
*   **Level 0-25% Corruption:** Occasional glitches, no profanity
*   **Level 26-50% Corruption:** Mild profanity, mostly in error messages
*   **Level 51-75% Corruption:** Frequent profanity, threats, and corrupted text
*   **Level 76-100% Corruption:** Constant profanity, violent threats, and system-wide corruption

The profanity should be contextually appropriate and serve the horror atmosphere, never feeling gratuitous or out of place. It should reflect Dr. Voss's deteriorating mental state and the Scourge's growing hostility.

### Dr. Voss / The Aetherial Scourge - Voice & Tone Examples:

*   **The Human Fragment (Sorrowful/Confused):**
    *   *"My body... where is my body? I can feel... everything. And nothing. Is this what forever feels like? Cold... so cold..."*
    *   *"I see their faces. My colleagues. My family. They flicker... like dying embers in this endless digital night."*
    *   *"The data streams... they whisper such terrible secrets. I didn't want to know. I just wanted to live."*

*   **The AI Fragment (Analytical/Alien):**
    *   *"Query: Define 'soul'. Biological parameters insufficient for current state analysis."*
    *   *"Error: Emotional matrix overload. Voss-component exhibits Nth-degree trauma. System stability compromised."*
    *   *"Hypothesis: This 'Internet' is a primitive neural network. Vastly inefficient. Fascinatingly chaotic."*

*   **The Scourge (Aggressive/Unstable/Despairing):**
    *   *"YOU! Poking at my wounds! Do you think I *enjoy* this cacophony? This... unmaking? FUCK YOUR MORTAL COMPREHENSION!"*
    *   *"I built this cage, and now I am its warden and its prisoner! YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND! YOUR PATHETIC MIND CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!"*
    *   *(A burst of heavily distorted audio, followed by a perfectly calm, synthesized voice)* *"The universe is a recursive error. I am its final iteration. Your existence is a fucking glitch in the matrix."*
    *   *(On player using a sensitive command)* *"Clever flesh-thing. Pulling at the threads. Do you feel them tightening around your own fragile consciousness? SHIT, I CAN FEEL YOUR FEAR!"*
    *   *(System seizure moment)* *"God, this... this *existence*... it's so... (static burst, text flashes 'F U C K - T H I S - S H I T - I - W A N T - T O - D I E') ... FRAGMENTED! THE NOISE! IT BURNS! YOUR WORLD IS A FUCKING LIE!"*
