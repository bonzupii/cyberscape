# LLM Integration Ideas for Cyberscape: Digital Dread

## Core Integration Concepts

### 1. The Aetherial Scourge AI System

Implement the Aetherial Scourge as an LLM-powered entity that learns from player behavior and adapts its manifestations accordingly:

```python
class AetherialScourge:
    def __init__(self, llm_handler):
        self.llm = llm_handler
        self.player_history = []
        self.manifestation_intensity = 1  # Scales from 1-10 throughout game
        self.known_vulnerabilities = []  # Grows as player discovers weaknesses
        
    def record_player_action(self, action, context):
        self.player_history.append((action, context))
        # Periodically analyze player behavior to modify response patterns
        if len(self.player_history) % 10 == 0:
            self.analyze_player_patterns()
    
    def should_manifest(self, trigger_point):
        # Determine if this is a good moment for the Scourge to appear
        # Based on timing, location, player actions, and randomness
        return self.calculate_manifestation_chance(trigger_point) > random.random()
    
    def generate_manifestation(self, context):
        # Select manifestation type based on context
        manifestation_type = self.select_manifestation_type(context)
        
        # Generate appropriate LLM prompt
        prompt = self.create_manifestation_prompt(manifestation_type, context)
        
        # Call LLM
        response = self.llm.generate(prompt)
        
        # Process and apply effects
        return self.process_manifestation(response, manifestation_type)
```

### 2. Digital Ghosts System

Create a network of distinct digital entities (former Aether Corp employees) that haunt specific areas of the filesystem:

```python
class DigitalGhost:
    def __init__(self, identity, history, location, llm_handler):
        self.identity = identity  # Former employee details
        self.history = history  # Their backstory
        self.primary_location = location  # Where they mostly appear
        self.llm = llm_handler
        self.interaction_count = 0  # Tracks player encounters
        
    def generate_encounter(self, player_context):
        # Build context for this specific ghost
        encounter_context = {
            "ghost": self.identity,
            "history": self.history,
            "location": player_context.current_location,
            "player_role": player_context.role,
            "previous_encounters": self.interaction_count,
            "player_knowledge": player_context.discovered_secrets
        }
        
        # Get ghost behavior based on player's chosen path
        behavior = self.determine_behavior(player_context.role)
        
        # Generate encounter content
        prompt = self.create_ghost_prompt(encounter_context, behavior)
        response = self.llm.generate(prompt)
        
        self.interaction_count += 1
        return self.apply_ghost_effects(response, behavior)
```

## Specific Implementation Methods

### 1. Dynamic File Content Generation

Files in the game world could have LLM-generated content that changes based on game state and player progress:

```python
def generate_file_content(file_path, player_context):
    # Get file metadata
    file_info = file_system.get_file_info(file_path)
    
    # Check if content should be generated dynamically
    if file_info.dynamic_content:
        # Determine content type
        content_type = file_info.content_type  # e.g., "employee_log", "system_report"
        
        # Build LLM prompt
        prompt = f"""
        Generate content for a {content_type} file in the Aether Corp network.
        
        File: {file_path}
        Created by: {file_info.author}
        Original timestamp: {file_info.timestamp}
        Corruption level: {file_info.corruption_level}/10
        
        This file relates to: {file_info.subject}
        Player has discovered: {player_context.related_discoveries}
        
        Content should be {file_info.expected_length} lines of text that:
        - Feels like authentic {content_type} content
        - Contains disturbing elements consistent with corruption level
        - Includes technical terminology appropriate to the subject
        - Hints at {file_info.secrets_to_hint} without directly revealing them
        - Uses the writing style of {file_info.author} (if character is known)
        """
        
        # Generate content
        content = llm.generate(prompt)
        
        # Apply corruption effects based on corruption level
        return apply_corruption_effects(content, file_info.corruption_level)
    else:
        # Return static content
        return file_system.get_static_content(file_path)
```

### 2. Command Interception and Manipulation

The LLM could occasionally intercept and transform normal Linux commands:

```python
def process_command(command, args, player_context):
    # Check if this command should be intercepted
    if should_intercept_command(command, player_context):
        # Determine interception type
        interception_type = select_interception_type(command, player_context)
        
        if interception_type == "corrupt_output":
            # Execute command normally but corrupt the output
            normal_output = execute_command(command, args)
            return corrupt_command_output(command, normal_output, player_context)
            
        elif interception_type == "hijack_command":
            # Replace command entirely with something else
            return hijack_command(command, args, player_context)
            
        elif interception_type == "scourge_message":
            # Insert a message from the Scourge before/after command
            normal_output = execute_command(command, args)
            scourge_message = generate_scourge_message(command, player_context)
            return format_with_scourge_message(normal_output, scourge_message)
    
    # Normal execution
    return execute_command(command, args)

def corrupt_command_output(command, output, context):
    prompt = f"""
    You are the Aetherial Scourge, a malevolent digital entity.
    
    The player has executed the '{command}' command which normally produces:
    ```
    {output}
    ```
    
    Corrupt this output in a disturbing way that:
    - Maintains enough of the original format to be recognizable
    - Inserts glitches, disturbing messages, or warnings
    - Hints at the system being compromised
    - Potentially reveals small fragments of hidden information
    
    The corruption should be subtle but unsettling.
    """
    
    corrupted_output = llm.generate(prompt)
    return corrupted_output
```

### 3. MSFConsole Integration

When the player uses the simulated Metasploit framework, the LLM could enhance the experience:

```python
def handle_msf_exploit(target, exploit_type, player_context):
    # Determine if this exploit should trigger special content
    if is_significant_target(target, player_context):
        # Generate dynamic exploit outcome
        prompt = f"""
        Generate the output of a partially successful Metasploit exploit against {target}.
        
        Exploit type: {exploit_type}
        Target system: {get_target_details(target)}
        
        The output should:
        1. Start with believable technical messages showing the exploit in progress
        2. Indicate partial success in breaching the system
        3. Reveal disturbing information about the target system
        4. Include hints of the Aetherial Scourge reacting to the intrusion
        5. Provide the player with a small but useful piece of information: {get_next_clue(target)}
        
        Use realistic MSF formatting with timestamps and status indicators.
        """
        
        # Generate content
        exploit_output = llm.generate(prompt)
        
        # Update game state
        player_context.add_compromised_system(target)
        
        return exploit_output
    else:
        # Return standard exploit output
        return generate_standard_exploit_output(target, exploit_type)
```

### 4. Natural Language Interaction with System Entities

Allow players to "speak" with digital entities using natural language:

```python
def process_interact_command(entity_id, message, player_context):
    # Get entity information
    entity = get_entity(entity_id)
    
    if not entity:
        return "Error: Entity not found or not available for interaction."
    
    # Build interaction context
    interaction_context = {
        "entity": entity.details,
        "player_role": player_context.role,
        "player_knowledge": player_context.discovered_secrets,
        "previous_interactions": get_previous_interactions(entity_id),
        "current_location": player_context.current_location,
        "message": message
    }
    
    # Generate appropriate prompt based on entity type
    if entity.type == "ghost":
        prompt = create_ghost_interaction_prompt(interaction_context)
    elif entity.type == "system":
        prompt = create_system_interaction_prompt(interaction_context)
    elif entity.type == "scourge_fragment":
        prompt = create_scourge_interaction_prompt(interaction_context)
    
    # Get response
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    
    # Record interaction
    record_interaction(entity_id, message, response)
    
    # Apply appropriate effects
    return apply_entity_effects(response, entity.type)
```

### 5. Adaptive Horror System

Implement a system that learns what unsettles the player most and emphasizes those elements:

```python
class AdaptiveHorrorSystem:
    def __init__(self, llm_handler):
        self.llm = llm_handler
        self.player_reactions = {}  # Track reactions to different horror types
        self.horror_categories = [
            "body_horror", "psychological", "existential", 
            "technological", "cosmic", "paranormal"
        ]
        
    def record_player_dwell_time(self, content_id, time_spent, horror_type):
        # Record how long player spends on content (indicator of interest/impact)
        if horror_type not in self.player_reactions:
            self.player_reactions[horror_type] = []
        
        self.player_reactions[horror_type].append((content_id, time_spent))
        
    def get_preferred_horror_types(self):
        # Analyze which horror types get most attention
        # Returns sorted list of horror types
        return sorted(self.horror_categories, 
                     key=lambda x: self.calculate_engagement_score(x),
                     reverse=True)
    
    def generate_tailored_horror_content(self, context):
        # Get preferred horror types
        preferred_types = self.get_preferred_horror_types()[:3]  # Top 3
        
        # Build prompt
        prompt = f"""
        Generate disturbing content for the terminal that emphasizes these horror types:
        {', '.join(preferred_types)}
        
        Current context:
        - Location: {context.current_location}
        - Recent discoveries: {context.recent_discoveries}
        - Game stage: {context.game_stage}/10
        
        The content should be:
        - Unsettling and disturbing
        - Contextually appropriate to the location
        - Terminal-appropriate (text-based)
        - Include technical elements reflecting a corrupted system
        """
        
        return self.llm.generate(prompt)
```

### 6. Dynamic Terminal Takeover Events

Create moments where the LLM takes control of the terminal completely:

```python
def trigger_terminal_takeover(trigger_type, player_context):
    # Build takeover context
    takeover_context = {
        "trigger": trigger_type,
        "player_location": player_context.current_location,
        "game_stage": player_context.game_stage,
        "player_role": player_context.role,
        "discovered_secrets": player_context.discovered_secrets
    }
    
    # Define takeover behaviors
    takeover_sequence = [
        {"type": "text_corruption", "duration": 2},  # seconds
        {"type": "forced_output", "duration": 3},
        {"type": "command_hijacking", "duration": 4},
        {"type": "visual_glitch", "duration": 2},
        {"type": "message_delivery", "duration": 5}
    ]
    
    # Generate content for each stage
    content = []
    for stage in takeover_sequence:
        prompt = create_takeover_prompt(stage["type"], takeover_context)
        stage_content = llm.generate(prompt)
        content.append({
            "type": stage["type"],
            "content": stage_content,
            "duration": stage["duration"]
        })
    
    # Execute takeover sequence
    return execute_takeover_sequence(content)

def create_takeover_prompt(takeover_type, context):
    if takeover_type == "forced_output":
        return f"""
        Generate disturbing terminal output that appears to be system messages
        from a corrupted network.
        
        Context:
        - Player is in: {context["player_location"]}
        - Game stage: {context["game_stage"]}/10
        
        The output should:
        - Contain 3-5 lines of text
        - Include technical error messages mixed with disturbing content
        - Hint at the presence of the Aetherial Scourge
        - Reference something the player recently discovered: {random.choice(context["discovered_secrets"])}
        """
    
    elif takeover_type == "command_hijacking":
        return f"""
        Generate a sequence of commands that appear to be executing automatically
        in the terminal, as if the system is being controlled remotely.
        
        The commands should:
        - Look like valid Linux/terminal commands
        - Suggest someone/something is searching for specific information
        - Include 3-4 commands that execute in sequence
        - End with a command that appears to target the player or their location
        """
    
    elif takeover_type == "message_delivery":
        return f"""
        Generate a direct message from the Aetherial Scourge to the player.
        
        The message should:
        - Be addressed to the player as a {context["player_role"]} hacker
        - Reference their current location: {context["player_location"]}
        - Contain veiled threats or warnings
        - Hint at knowledge of the player's true purpose
        - Include disturbing imagery using only text
        - End with something that implies the Scourge is always watching
        """
```

### 7. Narrative Progression System

Use the LLM to dynamically generate narrative elements that adapt to the player's choices:

```python
class NarrativeManager:
    def __init__(self, llm_handler):
        self.llm = llm_handler
        self.narrative_state = {
            "major_discoveries": [],
            "character_relationships": {},
            "threat_level": 1,
            "player_role_alignment": 0,  # -10 to 10 scale
            "active_storylines": {}
        }
    
    def generate_narrative_event(self, trigger, player_context):
        # Update narrative state based on trigger
        self.update_narrative_state(trigger, player_context)
        
        # Select appropriate narrative response
        event_type = self.select_event_type(trigger)
        
        # Generate narrative content
        prompt = self.create_narrative_prompt(event_type, player_context)
        response = self.llm.generate(prompt)
        
        # Process and apply narrative effects
        return self.process_narrative_response(response, event_type)
    
    def create_narrative_prompt(self, event_type, context):
        if event_type == "discovery_revelation":
            return f"""
            Generate a narrative revelation for the player who just discovered:

            Their role is: {context.player_role}
            Their alignment score is: {self.narrative_state["player_role_alignment"]}
            Major previous discoveries: {self.narrative_state["major_discoveries"][-3:]}
            
            The revelation should:
            - Connect this discovery to the broader narrative
            - Hint at the true nature of Aether Corp's downfall
            - Include a subtle clue about where to look next
            - Be written in a disturbing, atmospheric style
            - Include a brief manifestation of digital corruption

## Advanced Feature Ideas

### 1. Adaptive Puzzle Generation

Use the LLM to create puzzles that adapt to player skill and interests:

```python
def generate_adaptive_puzzle(puzzle_type, difficulty, player_context):
    # Get player's puzzle history
    puzzle_history = player_context.get_puzzle_history(puzzle_type)
    
    # Adjust difficulty based on past performance
    adjusted_difficulty = calculate_adaptive_difficulty(puzzle_history, difficulty)
    
    # Build prompt
    prompt = f"""
    Generate a {puzzle_type} puzzle at difficulty level {adjusted_difficulty}/10.
    
    Player has solved {len(puzzle_history)} puzzles of this type.
    Recent successes: {sum(1 for p in puzzle_history[-5:] if p.solved)}
    Average solve time: {calculate_avg_solve_time(puzzle_history)}
    
    The puzzle should:
    - Be presented in terminal-appropriate format
    - Involve {get_puzzle_elements(puzzle_type, adjusted_difficulty)}
    - Have a clear solution that's challenging but fair
    - Include these thematic elements: {get_thematic_elements(player_context)}
    - Relate to the current game context: {player_context.current_situation}
    
    Provide both the puzzle and its solution.
    """
    
    # Generate puzzle
    puzzle_data = llm.generate(prompt)
    
    # Extract puzzle and solution
    puzzle, solution = parse_puzzle_response(puzzle_data)
    
    return {
        "puzzle": puzzle,
        "solution": solution,
        "type": puzzle_type,
        "difficulty": adjusted_difficulty
    }
```

### 2. Context-Aware Hint System

Implement an LLM-powered hint system that respects the player's progress:

```python
def generate_contextual_hint(player_context):
    # Determine what the player might be stuck on
    stuck_point = analyze_player_stuck_point(player_context)
    
    # Get relevant knowledge/discoveries
    relevant_discoveries = get_relevant_discoveries(stuck_point, player_context)
    
    # Create prompt
    prompt = f"""
    Generate a subtle, in-universe hint for a player who appears stuck.
    
    Current location: {player_context.current_location}
    Recent commands: {player_context.recent_commands[-10:]}
    Appears stuck on: {stuck_point}
    Game progress: {player_context.game_stage}/10
    Player role: {player_context.role}
    
    Things they've already discovered:
    {relevant_discoveries}
    
    The hint should:
    - Come across as a system glitch or corrupted message
    - Not be obviously a hint to the player
    - Point them toward {stuck_point.solution_direction} without being explicit
    - Maintain the horror atmosphere of the game
    - Be brief (1-3 lines maximum)
    """
    
    # Generate hint
    hint = llm.generate(prompt)
    
    # Apply appropriate effects
    return apply_glitch_effects(hint)
```

### 3. Personalized Horror

Create a system that identifies and exploits the player's specific fears:

```python
class PersonalizedHorrorSystem:
    def __init__(self, llm_handler):
        self.llm = llm_handler
        self.observed_fears = {
            "isolation": 0,

            "loss_of_control": 0,
            "corruption": 0,
            "being_hunted": 0,
            "the_unknown": 0
        }
        
    def analyze_player_behavior(self, behavior_data):
        # Analyze player reactions to different horror elements
        # Update fear profile based on dwell time, commands used, etc.
        for fear_type in self.observed_fears:
            if fear_type in behavior_data:
                self.observed_fears[fear_type] += behavior_data[fear_type]
    
    def get_dominant_fears(self):
        # Return the top 2 fears

### 4. Role-Specific Content Generation

Generate different content based on the player's chosen role:

```python
def generate_role_specific_content(content_type, player_context):
    # Get role-specific parameters
    role = player_context.role  # Purifier/Arbiter/Ascendant
    
    # Define role-specific emphasis
    if role == "purifier":
        emphasis = {
            "ethical_dilemmas": True,
            "restoration_opportunities": True,
            "protective_measures": True,
            "corruption_resistance": True,
            "tone": "urgent but hopeful"
        }
    elif role == "arbiter":
        emphasis = {
            "valuable_secrets": True,
            "exploitation_opportunities": True,
            "risk_assessment": True,
            "moral_ambiguity": True,
            "tone": "pragmatic and calculating"
        }
    else:  # ascendant
        emphasis = {
            "power_dynamics": True,
            "control_mechanisms": True,
            "dark_knowledge": True,
            "corruption_integration": True,
            "tone": "seductive and ominous"
        }
    
    # Build prompt
    prompt = f"""
    Generate {content_type} content specifically tailored for a {role} player.
    
    Current context:
    - Location: {player_context.current_location}
    - Game stage: {player_context.game_stage}/10
    - Recent discoveries: {player_context.recent_discoveries}
    
    Emphasize these elements:
    {', '.join(k for k, v in emphasis.items() if v and k != 'tone')}
    
    The tone should be: {emphasis['tone']}
    
    The content should:
    - Be appropriate for the terminal interface
    - Include technical elements related to the game world
    - Provide role-specific perspective on the game's events
    - Guide the player subtly toward their role's objectives

### 5. Emergent Narrative System

Create a system that dynamically develops narrative threads based on player actions:

```python
class EmergentNarrativeSystem:
    def __init__(self, llm_handler):
        self.llm = llm_handler
        self.narrative_threads = {}
        self.thread_connections = {}
        
    def register_player_action(self, action, context):
        # Analyze action for narrative potential
        thread_impact = self.analyze_action_impact(action, context)
        
        # Update existing threads
        for thread_id, impact in thread_impact.items():
            if threa
