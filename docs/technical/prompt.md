## Phase 3: Content Population & Core Loop Refinement

**Status: IN PROGRESS**

10. **[✓] Populate Content:**
    *   **Status: COMPLETED**
    *   ✓ **File System:** Added story-relevant files including `voss_lab_notes.txt` with Dr. Voss's research logs and `incident_report_27.txt` detailing the Aether Incident.
    *   ✓ **Puzzles:** Created additional puzzle definitions following the JSON schema:
        *   Added `cipher_001.json` - An encrypted message puzzle with story integration
        *   Added `file_manipulation_001.json` - A system configuration repair puzzle
        *   Ensured puzzles have meaningful rewards and story connections
    *   ✓ **Narrative:** Enhanced narrative content with detailed logs of Dr. Voss's consciousness transfer experiment and the aftermath of the Aether Incident.
    *   ✓ **LLM Prompts:** Refined the implementation of Rusty's responses with appropriate context handling.

11. **[ ] Implement Core Gameplay Loops:**
    *   **Exploration -> Puzzle -> Reward/Story:** Define and implement how players discover puzzles (e.g., finding a corrupted file, an LLM hint from Rusty, an observation in a log) and how solving them progresses the story or gives new abilities/access.
    *   **Corruption Mechanics:** Ensure the `CorruptionProfile` in `effects.py` is dynamically updated by relevant game actions (failing puzzles, triggering certain commands, story events). The `game_state_manager.corruption_level` should visibly and audibly affect the game via `EffectManager` and `AudioManager`.

12. **[ ] Role-Specific Paths:**
    *   Start implementing more significant differences in available commands, puzzle hints/solutions, story outcomes, and character interactions based on the chosen `player_role`.

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish

**Status: PENDING**

13. **[ ] Full Effect Implementation:**
    *   Complete all stubbed visual and audio effects in `effects.py` and `audio_manager.py`. Ensure they are triggered appropriately by game events and the `EffectManager`.

14. **[ ] Rusty's Full Integration:**
    *   Ensure `STTRustyListener` voice commands correctly trigger `LLMHandler.generate_rusty_response`.
    *   Rusty's responses should be displayed via `RustyBufferRenderer` with appropriate visual and audio effects tied to his annotations.
    *   Implement Rusty's mood and knowledge systems in `LLMHandler` to influence his responses dynamically.

15. **[ ] Story Manager - Branching and Endings:**
    *   Fully implement the story branching logic in `StoryManager` based on player choices, solved puzzles, and role.
    *   Define and implement conditions for reaching different game endings (`STATE_GAME_OVER`, `STATE_VICTORY`, and potentially nuanced endings).

16. **[ ] Persistence:**
    *   Implement robust saving and loading (consider JSON as previously discussed). Ensure all necessary game state from all managers (`GameStateManager`, `FileSystemHandler`, `PuzzleManager`, `StoryManager`, `EffectManager`, `LLMHandler` for Rusty's state) is included. Add `save` and `load` commands.

17. **[ ] Testing and Balancing:**
    *   Use automated testing to verify different paths and command sequences.
    *   Manually playtest all roles and significant story branches.
    *   Balance puzzle difficulty, resource management (if any), corruption effects, and story pacing.
